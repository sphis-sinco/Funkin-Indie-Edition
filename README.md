# Indie Edition

Boredom and being petty and not wanting to have modern quality of life features unless I add them myself.
And also a minecraft java edition kinda thing for FNF seemed cool to me so yeah

[DOCS](./docs/README.md)

## Note

I don't call it "Indie Edition" as some sort of "FNF isn't indie anymore" kinda thing, I just find indie projects to be the cool things held together by duct tape.

Like something you would've made with cardboard as a kid.

# Differences

## SCRIPTING!

As of `0.2.0`, scripts have been supported in Indie Edition

### Misc Scripts

Added in `0.2.0`, Misc Scripts are background scripts or just scripts without labels.

While simple, they can be VERY powerful.

With Misc Scripts it's just alot of checking specific values if you want them to do things.
